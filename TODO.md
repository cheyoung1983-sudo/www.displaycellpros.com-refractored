# Deployment Preparation: Final Manual Steps

The project build is currently stabilized after major dependency upgrades and configuration fixes. The following manual steps are required to resolve the remaining 3 TypeScript errors before successful deployment.

## 1. Fix Component Imports [DONE]
The components were failing to import constants because they were attempting to import from `src/lib/constants` (a file that does not exist or has no exports) instead of `src/lib/constants.tsx` or `src/lib/ui-constants`.

- **Action Taken:** Updated imports in `www.displaycellpros.com-refractored` to use the correct paths.

## 2. Resolve Vercel Auth OIDC Import [DONE]
The build was failing because `createSigner` is not found on `@vercel/functions/oidc`.

- **Action Taken:** Migrated imports from the deprecated `@vercel/functions/oidc` to the modern `@vercel/oidc-aws-credentials-provider` in `src/lib/db.ts` and removed the unused import in `src/lib/vercelAuth.ts`.

## 3. Resolve Prisma Client Generation [DONE]
The build failed with `Type error: Module '"@prisma/client"' has no exported member 'PrismaClient'` and then `P1012: The datasource property url is no longer supported in schema files`.

- **Action Taken:** Removed `url = env("DATABASE_URL")` from `prisma/schema.prisma` to comply with Prisma 7 standards.
- **Action Taken:** Verified `prisma.config.ts` exists and contains the migration `datasource.url`.
- **Action Taken:** Added `prisma generate` to the `build` script in `package.json`.

## 4. Final Deployment
Once the above steps are completed:
1. Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to verify 0 errors.
2. Run `npm run build` to verify production build success.
3. Deploy to Vercel:
   ```bash
   npx vercel --prod
   ```
